/*
	*	PhoneBook::PhoneBook() : contactCount(0), currentIndex(0) {};
		-	Member initializer list in C++: It is used to initialize class 
			member variables before the constructor's body is executed.

		-	PhoneBook::PhoneBook() :
			This is the constructor of the PhoneBook class. 
			It is the special function that gets called when you create 
			an object of the PhoneBook class.

			Example: When you do PhoneBook myPhoneBook;, this constructor gets invoked.

		-	contactCount(0), currentIndex(0) :
			These are the member initializer list. 
			They are used to initialize the member variables of the class.
			It means that before the constructorâ€™s body {} is executed, the member 
			variables contactCount and currentIndex will be initialized to 0.
		
		-	{} :
			This is the body of the constructor. 
			It is where you can write the code that you want to execute when 
			the object is created.

		Why Use a Member Initializer List?
		-	Efficiency:
			For primitive types like int, it makes little difference whether you use a member initializer list or initialize the variables in the constructor body. However, for non-primitive types (such as objects or const members), member initializer lists are more efficient because they avoid calling the default constructor first and then assigning values.

		-	Const and Reference Members:
			If your class contains const or reference members, they must be initialized in the member initializer list because they cannot be assigned to later in the constructor body.

		-	Clarity:
			It makes it clear what the initial values of your member variables are, which can improve the readability of your code.
