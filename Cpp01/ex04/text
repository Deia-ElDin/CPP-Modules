s1 is a placeholder for something. In many cases, s1 can be replaced by something more meaningful. 
Let's see how many times we can use s1. s1 is a simple example, but s1 can be used in various ways. 
We can have sentences where s1 is repeated, like here: s1, s1, s1. 
Finally, when we replace s1 with s2, s1 will disappear, and s2 will take its place.
